## Learning Experience
Starting this course with no prior experience in Blender or Python, our journey through the assignments was both challenging and rewarding. Assignment A1 provided a smooth introduction to the basics, helping us build confidence with simple scripts. As we progressed through Assignments A2 to A4, the focus shifted to creating a script to calculate the *Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR)* for the facade of a generic building. Our initial approach was to design three interconnected scripts: *one to identify glass objects, another to isolate facade elements, and a third to calculate their external areas.*

While this approach seemed straightforward at first, A3 revealed the complexities involved in calculating facade properties for generic buildings. After significant trial and error, we incorporated raycasting techniques to refine the script, eventually achieving results that closely matched our expectations. This iterative process was instrumental in enhancing our problem-solving skills and demonstrating the potential of coding and automation for architectural analysis. Reflecting upon this in A5 has been invaluable, allowing us to recognize our shortcomings, learn from mistakes, and gain new perspectives from others.

At the beginning of the course, we would categorize ourselves as Modelers, primarily focused on basic modeling tasks. Through the assignments, we progressed to the Self-Learner level, reflecting the ability to independently explore and apply Python scripting within Blender. However, there remains much to learn, particularly regarding advanced OpenBIM tools and methodologies that could further enhance our understanding of digital workflows and building performance analysis.

## Process of Developing the Tutorial
The tutorial development process required us to consolidate everything we had learned and present it in a way that was accessible to others. Our focus was on guiding users through the logic and functionality of our script while highlighting the challenges we encountered and how we overcame them. This process helped us understand the methods we used even better, particularly raycasting, and helped us see our work through the eyes of potential users.

Having the freedom to choose our use case was both a strength and a challenge. While it allowed us to focus on a topic that interested us, it was sometimes difficult to determine whether our approach met the course criteria. For students that are not familiar with Python or Blender more guidance would have been helpful. Additionally, while the variety of tools introduced in the course felt enough, some lectures on Python programming could be appreciated.

## Feedback on the Tutorial
The feedback we received from our peers was about the code and its uses, emphasizing the functionality of our tool and its alignment with the identified use case. A lot of the questions came up from the use of raycasting and how it works, and some suggestions highlighted that our code does not work well with full external blinders on the windows of the facade of the building. This feedback was valuable in helping us understand how to improve both the usability and presentation of our work.

## Future use for Advanced OpenBIM (Individual)

### Tilemachos Tsontakis
At this stage, I am still uncertain whether I will directly use OpenBIM tools in my thesis, as it depends on the direction my research takes. However, the skills and knowledge gained from working with OpenBIM tools will definitely prove valuable. Looking further ahead, I am confident that OpenBIM tools and Python will play a significant role in my professional life as an architectural engineer over the next 10 years. The ability to integrate these tools into design, analysis, and project management will be essential for addressing architectural challenges effectively.

Starting this course with no prior experience in Blender or Python, Assignment A1 provided a smooth introduction, allowing me to build confidence through simple scripts. Progressing to Assignments A2 to A4, we aimed to create a script to calculate the Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) for the facade of a generic building. My initial approach involved designing three scripts: one to identify glass objects, another to isolate fa√ßade elements, and a third to calculate their external areas. However, as we worked on A3, it became evident that calculating the facade properties of a generic building would be more complex than anticipated. After significant trial and error, we incorporated raycasting techniques, eventually creating a script that closely resembled what we had imagined. This process was challenging but rewarding, enhancing my problem-solving skills and demonstrating the potential of coding and automation for architectural analysis. Reflecting upon this work in A5 has been particularly valuable, as it provides an opportunity to understand my shortcomings, learn from mistakes, and gain insight from other perspectives, which is essential for growth and improvement.



### Katarina G. Voll
I will use OpenBIM in my thesis next semester, even though it is unlikely to be the primary focus of my work. As a student of Sustainability in Construction, I see OpenBIM as an essential tool for analyzing and implementing complex topics like the circular economy and energy efficiency. These aspects are central to my studies and form the foundation of my future professional career. The open standards and interoperability of OpenBIM are particularly valuable for developing and implementing sustainable strategies. I am confident that OpenBIM tools will play a significant role in my professional life over the next ten years. The construction industry's focus on sustainability demands modern, data-driven solutions, and OpenBIM provides an ideal foundation to meet these requirements. This was one of my primary motivations for taking this course: to enhance and deepen my skills in working with BIM. 

The course not only equipped me with new skills but also helped me overcome my initial uncertainties with tools like Python. At the start, I had no prior experience with Blender or Python, but Assignments A1 and A2 provided a good introduction, allowing me to build confidence through simple scripts.
For our project, Tille and I developed a script to calculate the Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) of building facades. Our goal was to create a flexible and adaptable code that could be applied to various building types, which posed a significant challenge. To address this, we implemented a raycasting technique, which proved to be a major breakthrough in achieving our objective. This process was both educational and motivating, as it highlighted the importance of experimentation and iteration in programming.

Overall, the course not only enhanced my skills in OpenBIM and programming but also equipped me to tackle future challenges in practice. I am very glad I took this course, as it demonstrated how quickly beginners can achieve success. OpenBIM and Python are tools that will be central to my academic journey and will continue to play an important role in my professional career.



## Wrap-Up
- **A1:** We decided to focus on materials-LCA within our group and familiarized ourselves with Blender and Python, helping us build foundational skills and confidence.
- **A2:** We started thinking about how we could design the code for our use case and what we hope to achieve. We decided on the basic concept of how the script would work and its intended purpose once completed.
- **A3:** We spent most of our time on this assignment. We realized that it is really difficult to calculate the facade area of a building with accuracy in Blender using Python and accepted that our code would have limitations and would have served as a good foundation for calculating the WWR of a building. At this stage, raycasting was introduced to our code and  we kept refining our code.
- **A4:** The tutorial was created with the goal of guiding users through the installation process and use of Blender as well as explaining how our script works and what it can be used for.
- **A5:** This assignment enabled reflection on the entire process, highlighting both achievements and areas for improvement, and providing valuable insights for future applications of OpenBIM.
